    "Type of question": "PE",
    "Answer": "ArcelorMittal SA carbon intensity increased in FY2020 compared to the FY2019. The key drivers of this carbon intensity change were:\n- A drop in the Group's steel output due to COVID-19 impact, which was variable across sites but especially impactful in sites with the lowest carbon footprints.\n- A higher share, compared to the market, of production with a more carbon-intensive route",

For our steel operations, our footprint fell 20% to 148.5 million tonnes.\nWhile most of this decrease was as a result of the fall in the Group’s steel output due Covid-19, to\nsome extent it is also the result of a number of carbon and energy efficiency projects implemented\nin our steel operations in 2020.\nIn 2020, the average carbon intensity in our steel business was 2.08 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of steel,\na 1.6% improvement over 2019. In relation to the sites we operate today that we operated in 2007,\nin 2020 the specific Group footprint for the steel business decreased by 7.9% compared to 2007.\nThese metrics cover scopes 1, 2 and 3 as defined in our Basis of Reporting. This is based on data\nfor almost 100 steelmaking sites across the Group.\nDue to the variable impacts of Covid-19, production at some sites reduced more than at others.\nOn analysis, a general pattern has emerged that those sites where production was most reduced were\nalso those which perform better in terms of CO2. Therefore, the average impact of our CO2 reduction\nmeasures on CO2 intensity across the Group was lower than anticipated, and as a result we did not fully\nreach our 2020 CO2 reduction target.\nBy comparison, the global average figure provided by the World Steel Association is 1.83tCO2\/ts\n(worldsteel 2019). The key reason for our higher carbon intensity is that the share of our production\nfrom the more carbon-intensive primary steelmaking route stands at 81% – compared with 72% in the\nglobal steel market as a whole (worldsteel 2019).\nMaking primary steel via the BF-BoF route emits more CO2 than secondary steelmaking in the EAF. Yet\nmaking primary steel is a necessary investment to generate the recyclable scrap stocks of the future\nthat we need to enable fully circular steelmaking. In 2020, the average carbon intensity of our primary\n(BF-BoF) steelmaking operations fell by 0.86% year on year.}",

    "Document extracts": "doc1{For the first time, we are disclosing\na roadmap that shows our journey\nto net zero.\n2.2.1 Five levers\nOur roadmap features five levers –\nin essence, groupings of actions and\ninitiatives – that act as stepping stones\nto achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\nThese are:\nA. Steelmaking transformation\nB. Energy transformation\nC. Increased use of scrap\nD. Sourcing clean electricity\nE. Offsetting residual emissions\nA. Steelmaking transformation\nIn the course of the coming decades,\nthe steel industry will undergo a\ntransformation of the assets used to\nmake steel on a scale not seen for over\n100 years. This includes switching\nironmaking from the BF-BOF (Blast\nFurnace-Basic Oxygen Furnace) to the\nDRI, and from iron ore preparation in the\nsinter plant (using heat or pressure to\ncompact a material) to the pellet plant\n(which compresses or moulds the iron\nmaterial into the shape of a pellet).\nIronmaking with pellets in the DRI is\nusually coupled with EAF.\nHistorically there has been limited use\nof the DRI-EAF route except in regions\nwith a very low natural gas price.\nHowever, given the increasing cost of\ncarbon and the requirement to reduce\nemissions, transitioning to natural-gas\nbased DRI-EAF can be a first step with a\nproven technology that has the potential\nto further innovate and decarbonise\nthrough the use of green hydrogen. \n\nB. Energy transformation\nOver recent decades, the steel\nindustry has made enormous efficiency\nimprovements in the efficient use of\nenergy in BF-BOF steelmaking via\nmultiple technologies. Further\ninnovations continue to evolve which\nreduce CO2 emissions, such as the use\nof coke oven gas in the tuyeres of the\nblast furnace, drawing on the rich\nhydrogen content of the gas. However,\nthese innovations continue to rely\nsignificantly on the use of fossil fuels.\nThe energy used to make steel in future\nyears will undergo a further and more\nradical transition of the industry to clean\nenergy vectors, as we have described in\nour previous climate action reports. This\nwill involve shifting to one or combination\nof three alternatives: clean electricity\n(which could be in the form of green\nhydrogen), continued use of fossil carbon\ncoupled with CCS to ensure no carbon is\nemitted, and use of circular carbon either\nthrough natural or synthetic carbon\n\ncycles. Natural carbon cycles include use\nof sustainable forestry and agriculture\nresidues, to produce bioenergy for use\nin steelmaking. Emissions from use of\nthis bioenergy will be captured by the\nregrowth of the biomass waste used.\nSynthetic carbon cycles rely on use\nof waste plastics as energy source,\ntransforming the carbon in waste gases\nthrough CCU into equivalent new plastics,\nand ensuring no emissions are generated.\nC. Increased use of scrap\nAs well as using scrap in the EAF, we\ncan increase the use of low-quality\nscrap in BF-BOF steelmaking process\nby improving steel scrap sorting and\nclassification, installing scrap pre-melting\ntechnology and adjusting the steelmaking\nprocess to accommodate scrap.\nD. Clean electricity\nReducing our scope 2 emissions means\nmainly focusing on sourcing low-carbon\nelectricity. This will be an increasing\nchallenge for ArcelorMittal as we launch\nprojects to transition from BF-BOF\ntechnology to scrap and DRI-EAF\ntechnology, which will result in\nelectricity becoming a greater part of\nthe energy mix we use to make steel.\n\nWe recognise we cannot rely on\nthe electricity grid becoming more\ndecarbonised as a whole and need to\nfocus on increasing the amount of clean\nelectricity we consume. We plan to do\nthis by purchasing renewable energy\ncertificates and by direct power\npurchase agreements (PPA) with\nsuppliers from renewables projects.\nE. Offsetting residual emissions\nWhile ArcelorMittal is committed to\nachieving net zero by reducing CO2e\nemissions to the atmosphere from its\noperations, there are likely to remain\nresidual emissions for which either there\nwill be no feasible technological solution\nor the solution involves excessively high\neconomic or social costs.\nFor these residual emissions – today we\nestimate less than 5% of total emissions\n– ArcelorMittal will buy high-quality\noffsets or launch projects to generate\nhigh-quality carbon credits that would\nnot have happened without the\ncompany’s intervention.\n}",

In 2022, BNP Paribas also tightened its financing\nrestrictions in particularly sensitive ecosystems such as the\nArctic and the Amazon.\nIn 2023, the Group accelerated again its exit from fossil fuels:\nBNP Paribas no longer grants financing for the development\nof new oil or gas projects, regardless of the financing terms\n(project financing, reserve-based lending, FPSO), nor to nondiversified players in oil exploration and production\nAs of 30 September 2023, BNP Paribas’ financing of\nlow-carbon energies had reached EUR 32 billion, representing a total of 65% of the Group’s financing to energy\nproduction. Within the financing for low-carbon energy,\nrenewables accounted for EUR 28.8 billion, an increase of\nEUR 4 billion in one year due to an increase in financing of\nrenewables across all client segments (utilities, non power\ncompanies, households). Exposure to nuclear and biofuels\nremained stable over the last year. By 2030, the Group\nnow targets 90% of its energy financing towards low-carbon.}, doc1{1.4 BNP Paribas reduces its own operational emissions\nSince 2012, BNP Paribas has implemented a strategy to\nreduce the environmental impacts of its operations i.e. its\ndirect emissions (scope 1), its indirect emissions related to\nenergy purchases (scope 2) and its indirect emissions related\nto business travel (scope 3, cat. 6) increasing the share of\nlow-carbon electricity used. At end 2023, the carbon footprint\nper Full Time Equivalent was 1.56 tCO2\ne, being already lower\nthan the maximum target set for 2025. This figure also\nrepresents a reduction of 10% compared to 2022 and more\nthan 38% compared to 2019, the pre-Covid-19 reference\nyear. Additionally, since 2017, the Group annually purchases\nvoluntary carbon credits for an amount equivalent to the\nresidual greenhouse gas emissions emitted the previous year\nwithin its operating scope.}, doc1{In 2021, BNP Paribas created the Low-Carbon Transition\nGroup, a strong platform made up of 200 bankers at end2023 (with a target of 250 specialized bankers by end-2025)\ndedicated to supporting international clients, companies and\ninstitutional investors in accelerating their transition to a\nsustainable and low-carbon economy. A continuum of banking\nand non-banking solutions is therefore provided for the\ndecarbonisation of the economy, and particularly the energy,\nmobility and industry sectors. In addition to renewable\nenergy and the battery sector, this platform is particularly\nattentive to future technology projects, specifically green\nhydrogen.\nIn addition, the Low-Carbon Transition for SMEs & MidCaps\ninitiative supports SMEs and mid-sized companies in the\ntransition to net zero emissions in the Group’s five main\nDomestic Markets (France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and\nPoland) through dedicated tools, advisory and financing\noffers.\nIn Poland, BNP Paribas was a major player in the Baltic Power\nproject led by Orlen and Northland Power. A loan of more than\nEUR 4.4 billion will enable the construction of the first\noffshore wind farm in Polish waters.

This was the largest offshore\nwind project in Europe in 2023.}, doc1{DEVELOPING LOW-CARBON MOBILITY\nBNP Paribas is helping accelerate the development of the\nbattery sector in Europe, playing a key role in financing large\nprojects.\n BNP Paribas acted as joint sustainability structuring\ncoordinator during the successful placement of the first\nEUR 1.25 billion green bond for Stellantis, whose funds\nwill be mainly dedicated to the design, development\nand manufacture of 100% electric vehicles and electric\nvehicles fuel cells.\n AESC (Automotive Energy Supply Corporation), the world’s leading Japanese company in the design and production of batteries, was financed for an amount of more\nthan EUR 800 million for the planned construction of a\ngigafactory in France. BNP Paribas acted as mandated\nlead arranger. During the first phase of this large-scale\nproject, it is expected that 9 GWh of batteries will power\n200,000 electric vehicles produced each year from 2025\nby the manufacturer Renault.\n Northvolt raised USD 5 billion for expansion of Europe's\nfirst circular gigafactory. BNP Paribas acted as Exclusive\nSenior Debt Advisor and Tier 1 Senior Mandated Lead\nArranger. This deal represents the largest non-recourse\ngreen financing for a battery cell gigafactory in Europe.\nThe loan will facilitate the expansion of Northvolt Ett,\nEurope's first homegrown gigafactory, as well as the realisation of Northvolt's ambitious plans for battery recycling. The facility recovers battery-grade metals with a\ncarbon footprint that is 70% lower than mined raw materials, thereby enabling a fully integrated, circular battery\nproduction setup that has not previously existed outside\nof Asia.\nArval and BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions announced a new\noffering for both companies and individuals across Europe\nthat tackles a key barrier to electric vehicle adoption:\nconvenient and affordable charging points at home and in\nthe workplace. At Arval, the package includes leasing an\nelectric vehicle for companies or individuals, and charging\nstation installation, maintenance, and even removal and\nre-use or recycling if needed. For corporate clients, optional employee home charging reimbursement adds further\nvalue. Corporate fleet managers will be able to use “Leasing Solutions Charge & Lease” offer to roll-out and finance\na charging infrastructure package for their companies with\nvarious power levels, electric infrastructure, civil works,\nsignage, and installation support.\nIn France, to meet the expansion of bicycle use,\nBNP Paribas Personal Finance launched a new longterm rental offer for electric bicycles. The service is\nprovided as a monthly subscription, with different cost\nlevels depending on the bike, the options chosen and\nthe length of the contract. Users can use a high-quality bike for a period of 24 or 36 months, which is covered by insurance (breakage, theft, etc.) and serviced annually by a professional. Corporate have access as well\nto Arval bike leasing offer for their employees, a long\nterm rental solution of e-bikes, available in 14 countries, contributing to diversifying mobility means towards\nlow-carbon practice both for commuting and professional\njourneys}",

Estimation of CO₂ emission done on the basis of coal consumption and power generation. Amount of other GHG emission is minimal and its impact is negligible. Significant SPM reduction is being achieved at all stations through R&M of ESP. The company manages its emission through:\n\nAmbient Air Quality and Emission Monitoring\nAll NTPC power stations are equipped with Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AAQMS) to capture the real-time data of PM 10, PM 2.5, SOₓ, NOₓ, and access has been provided to regulators such as CPCB and SPCB. Additional ozone analyzers for ambient air are also being provided phase-wise at the existing stations. Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) have been installed recently in various operating stations.\n\nRe-adjustment of NTPC's fuel\/power generation mix\nIn order to reduce its carbon footprint, NTPC plans to gradually reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by readjusting its fuel\/power generation mix.\n\nWe intend to include non-fossil fuel-based power generation in our portfolio by setting up power plants based on hydro and renewable sources (solar, wind) of energy. Such generation does not have any CO₂ emissions.\n\nIntroduction of Thermodynamically Efficient Technologies\nNTPC has constantly improved the steam cycle parameters of its generating units with consequent improvements in the plant efficiencies and reduction in CO₂ emissions. Heat rates (which are a direct indicator of efficiency at which power is generated) of NTPC power plants have evolved and have shown an impressive improvement since inception of its first unit in 1978, resulting in commensurate reduction in CO₂ emission per unit of power generated.\n\nRenovation & Modernization of old power stations\nNTPC has taken up extensive renovation and modernization of its old power generating units to maintain\/upgrade their efficiencies. Such activities have helped improve emissions and hence improve their environmental performance to aid sustainable development.\n\nOzone Depleting Substances (ODS)\nNTPC is in the process of reducing the consumption of ODS substances by upgraded technologies and systems. More than half of the consumption has been reduced during the year as compared to FY 2013-14.\n\nOther new initiatives for reduction in GHG and pollutant emissions are described below:\n\ni. Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) activities – Modified amine absorption-based process to separate CO₂ from flue gas\nA pilot test facility on new CO₂ absorption technology has been set up by NTPC NETRA for carrying out energy studies on different amines. The experiment is targeted to identify a modified amine which will have 20-25% less energy in stripper columns as compared to Mono ethanolamine (MEA) process. A synthetic flue gas of N₂ and CO₂ mixture is used for experimentation.\n\nIt is indigenously developed technology in collaboration with IIT Guwahati and can be scaled up to 20 TPH flue gas capacity.}",

This follows the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, an international accounting tool. Greenhouse gases are divided into three groups, known as Scopes. Scope 1 emissions are generated directly on-site at RDI operations and by the company-owned vehicle fl eet. Emissions that arise indirectly through purchased energy belong to Scope 2 emissions . Scope 3 emissions are generated indirectly through business fl ights, incinerated waste, and upstream processes for the provision of energy carriers for RDI. All emissions are standardised and reported as CO 2 -equivalents (CO 2 -eq). RDI's business activities in 2023 resulted in a total greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 7’080 metric tons of CO 2 -eq. This represents a 28 percent increase compared to the previous year. The Scope 1 emissions come from the use of fossil fuels such as natural gas, heating oil, and fuels. These emissions have remained largely constant over the past few years. Since 2016, as electrical energy has been sourced from renewable sources, Scope 2 emissions have been zero. Scope 3 emissions show both the largest relative share and a large variation over time. Since most of the emissions are caused by RDI's business fl ights, a steep decrease can be observed from 2019 to 2021. This is due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the removal of most restrictions, the number of business fl ights rose again sharply in the course of 2022 and 2023. Not included are Scope 3 emissions from purchased and sold goods, upstream and downstream transportation and employees commuting. Some of these emissions are reported elsewhere, are not considered relevant, or there is not yet a suitable method for calculating them.

This represents a\n28 percent increase compared to the previous year.\nThe Scope 1 emissions come from the use of fossil fuels such as natural\ngas, heating oil, and fuels. These emissions have remained largely constant\nover the past few years.\nSince 2016, as electrical energy has been sourced from renewable sources,\nScope 2 emissions have been zero.\nScope 3 emissions show both the largest relative share and a large\nvariation over time. Since most of the emissions are caused by RDI's\nbusiness flights, a steep decrease can be observed from 2019 to 2021. Th\nis due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.}",

The\naim is to achieve an overall methane\ncapture rate of 80% (currently 57%)\nby 2032, a reduction of around\n5 Mt CO2 eq. compared with 2021.\nIn practical terms, methane\nemissions are measured using\non-site sensors, satellite data,\nand calculations based on the\nwaste tonnage entering each site.\nThe methane capture itself involves\nplacing a covering of membrane,\nclay, and earth over filled cells. Areas\ncurrently in operation are gradually\nfitted with capture pipework as the\ncells are filled. The captured gas is\nthen converted into energy (it is\nthe main component in natural gas)\nor flared off, if it cannot be converted\nlocally (with a significantly reduced\nimpact compared with venting – the\nrelease of methane into the open air,\nwhich is absolutely to be avoided).}, doc1{DECARBONIZING FURTHER\nTHROUGH SCOPE 4\nWe are working to decarbonize our customers’ activities (scope 4).\nWe have set the ambitious target of increasing\nour scope 4 by 50% by 2030 (compared with 2023).\n\nAs stated in the second part\nof this Climate Report, Veolia advocates\nthe use of a “scope 4” in ESG scoring\ncriteria.
